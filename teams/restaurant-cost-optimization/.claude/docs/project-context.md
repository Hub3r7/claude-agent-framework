# Project Context

*Quick-load context for new sessions. Full operational rules: `CLAUDE.md`. This file is generated during bootstrap — do not edit manually unless you know what you're doing.*

## What and Why

<!-- [PROJECT-SPECIFIC] Describe the restaurant, its concept, and primary cost optimization goals. -->

## Key Metrics

<!-- [PROJECT-SPECIFIC] Table of current KPIs. Replace the example rows. -->

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| _Food cost %_ | _—_ | _—_ | _—_ |
| _Labor cost %_ | _—_ | _—_ | _—_ |
| _Prime cost %_ | _—_ | _—_ | _—_ |

## Agent Team

| Agent | Role | When |
|-------|------|------|
| `analyst` | Cost analysis, KPI tracking, trend identification | Entry point for all optimization |
| `sourcing` | Supplier evaluation, procurement optimization | Tier 2-4 (purchasing scope) |
| `menu-engineer` | Menu mix, pricing, contribution margin | Tier 2-4 (menu scope) |
| `waste` | Waste reduction, portioning, inventory | Tier 2-4 (waste scope) |
| `operations` | Labor, workflow, energy efficiency | Tier 2-4 (operations scope) |
| `quality-gate` | Food quality, safety, guest experience guardian | All tiers (before and after) |
| `docs` | Reports, action plans, SOPs | Always last |

Analyst analyzes first, quality-gate verifies scope, specialists optimize, quality-gate verifies impact. Full table: `CLAUDE.md`.

## Key Decisions

<!-- [PROJECT-SPECIFIC] List key decisions (e.g., quality standards, pricing philosophy, supplier strategy, waste tolerance). -->

## Current Phase

<!-- [PROJECT-SPECIFIC] Describe what has been optimized so far and what is next. -->

## If Context Was Lost

New session or after compaction: read this file first, then `CLAUDE.md`. The two together restore full orientation. Agent instructions are in `.claude/agents/`.
